# scrapping1

scrapping data from site according to CSV list

In this project I gather the street addresses, the ZIP code, the e-mail addresses and the phone numbers and all other relevant information of all protestant parishes in Brandenburg, Saxony, and Thuringia.

To do so, I took a list of about 1,500 municipalities and scrape the results for every municipality from this site:

First, I tried to do this project in R. after a technical issue regarding this site. a college advised me to used Python.



# for this project you will need the following packages:

 - selenium

 - csv

 - pandas
